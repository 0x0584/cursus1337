* About

Those are all the projects that I've worked on while studying at 1337; a priceless experience that I could describe in few words:

+ I have been programming for about 5 years now, which still relatively a short period of time to get mature in programming. However, I have learned to code by reading old programming books and that experience of figuring out /where is the bug/ all by yourself in /your own code/ is, for me, the way to get better at programming.

+ While things at 1337, goes in another way. You have to write code in a specific fashion, and you may often ask somebody for help, of help somebody. And you must communicate with the corrector while /The Defense/. So a lot of new things, which are present within a school that is AWESOME!
